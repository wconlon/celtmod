celt.0.title;What is a King to an Emperor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.0.desc1;You have driven out the Saxon invaders reformed the legendary kingdom of King Arthur and united all Britons under your banner. As the destined son of your people it is only natural that the bards and chroniclers heap praise upon your name. Recently some have even gone so far as to proclaim you Emperor of Brittania. While achiving Imperial dignity is the dream of any ruler in Europe the title of Empire is traditionally only attributed to Rome and we do not currently have the power to enforce our claim through force of arms alone.\n\n The bards have done much to legitimize your rule in the eyes of your people. Perhaps with the proper nudging you could convince them to focus their efforts on legitimizing your claim to an Imperial title in the eyes of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.0.desc2;By uniting both the Gaels and the Brythons and driving out the troublesome Saxons you have proven yourself the undisputed master of the isles. Though not a Briton yourself you have recently noticed that your British subjects have begun including your family within their native myths and legends. Their bards call you the son of destiny, the return of King Arthur, and some even go so far as to name you Emperor of Britannia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.0.a;Arthur was content to be king and so am I;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.0.b;I deserve a grander title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.0.c;I prefer the Gaelic legends;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.0.d;Two empires are better than one;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.1.title;Magnus Maximus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1.desc;Most of Europe considers Britannia to rightfully be a province of the Roman empire and those who dream of restoring the glory of Rome are not keen to recognize any empire but Rome within its old borders. According to the Brythonic chronicles and legend however Emperor Magnus Maximus, known to the Britons as Macsen Wledig, granted the sovereignty of Britannia to a Welsh chief in exchange for his daughter's hand in marrage. Although Maximus is now considered a usurper, his gift of sovereignty could be a strong foundation for an imperial claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1.a;I'd rather not build my legacy on the acts of a usurper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1.b;All shall hear of Britannia's independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1.c;On his death we inherited his imperium!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.2.title;King Arthur's Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.2.desc;Despite never holding an imperial title, King Arthur is exalted above all but the greatest emperors in terms of prestige and renown. As the ones who drove out the Saxons and united the Britons, the Brythonic peoples consider the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] to be the spiritual successors of King Arthur. Sadly the subtleties of celtic prophesy are often lost on outsiders so our claim is not widely acknowledged outside our borders. Perhaps making my connection to King Arthur clearer would strengthen my imperial claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.2.a;Arthur was never an emperor. This is a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.2.b;Lets clarify a few points;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.2.c;It would make things a lot simpler to be related by blood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.3.title;The Imperial Title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.3.desc;The largest obstacle to any prospective empire in Europe is the insistance that only Rome should bare the title of Emperor. Your court bard has recently presented an idea that could make your imperial ambitions more palatable to the Romans. The title of Pendragon is one that carries unmatched dignity for the Britons. If we were to use Pendragon as our title rather than Emperor we could avoid any objections from Rome while still elevating our status above that of mere kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.3.a;Fussing about titles is a waste of time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.3.b;Pendragon is a much nicer title anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.3.c;What is the point of all this if I can't call myself Emperor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.title;The Legend of [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.desc.best;After months of work I have managed to produce a new account that I believe should strengthen my claim to an imperial title. What's more the changes we made are so subtle as to be unnoticable. Of course it doesn't matter how plausable the story is if no one remembers it. In order to ensure that our version of events is embraced by the bards, it should be committed to verse so it can be performed across the realm. The only question now is how much effort to commit to the task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.desc.good;After months of work I have managed to produce a new account that I believe should strengthen my claim to an imperial title. Some of the claims made may stretch the truth a little but not enough to be unbelievable. Of course it doesn't matter how plausable the story is if no one remembers it. In order to ensure that our version of events is embraced by the bards, it should be committed to verse so it can be performed across the realm. The only question now is how much effort to commit to the task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.desc.bad;After months of work I have managed to produce a new account that I believe should strengthen my claim to an imperial title. The new version of events strain plausability and it is fairly obvious that it was created just to validate your imperial ambitions. Of course it doesn't matter how plausable the story is if no one remembers it. In order to ensure that our version of events is embraced by the bards, it should be committed to verse so it can be performed across the realm. The only question now is how much effort to commit to the task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.desc.worst;After months of work I have managed to produce a new account that I believe should strengthen my claim to an imperial title. Your new account is a total fabrication. You even heard some of your councilors suppress a laugh when you read it. Of course it doesn't matter how plausable the story is if no one remembers it. In order to ensure that our version of events is embraced by the bards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x, it should be committed to verse so it can be performed across the realm. The only question now is how much effort to commit to the task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.a;I will stake my very reputation! I will not stop until every bard in the realm is reciting these words!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.b;Gather the most renowned bards in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.c;My court bard should be sufficient. This is what I pay him for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.4.d;My word is law! The bards will repeat what I say because I command them to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.5.title;History Refuses to Change;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.5.desc;Despite your best efforts, it seems as though your work has failed to catch on. Some say the stories are too far-fetched to be believable, others say people simply prefer the old poems more. Whatever the reason may be you must now decide how to respond to this setback;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.5.a;Lets adjust some of the details to make the story more believable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.5.b;I should have put more effort into spreading the story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.5.c;I give up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.6.title;The Power of Words;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.6.desc;Your new account of history has become a remarkable success! Not only are your words being recited by bards across the land, but they are now being recorded in the written chronicles as well. With the historical record now showing strong evidence of your imperial claim it is now time to announce to the world that you are seizing what is rightfully yours. In order to silence the doubts of any sceptics jealous of our ascendancy, the announcment should be accompanied by as much spectacle as can be mustered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.6.a;Hold a celebration more spectacular than the world has ever seen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.6.b;Lavish banquets! Month long festivals! Do it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.6.c;Prepare a ceremony but keep it dignified;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.6.d;The title is mine by right. I need no man's approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.7.title;Europe is not Amused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.7.desc;No matter how much I insist the other rulers of Europe refuse to acknowledge my imperial title. Even worse my insistance is beginning to have diplomatic consequences. Many kingdoms are now refusing to accept any of our diplomats until we cease our use of the imperial title. There are two options before me. I can either give up my imperial ambitions or make another attempt to convince my peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.7.a;I will not rest until the world acknowledges my right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.7.b;This isn't worth the cost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.8.title;The Empire of the Britons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.8.desc;After years of work I have finally achieved my dream! All throughout Europe acknowlege my right to an Imperial title and the Brythonic nation will forever be known as an Empire. Having surpassed even the greatness of King Arthur, I will certainly be remembered by history as one of the greatest rulers to ever live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.8.a;It was all worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.9.desc;Long have the Celtic peoples stood divided, easy pickings for conquerors over the millenia. From Julius Ceaser to Saxons and more, the land has been constantly ravaged by warfare. Worse still, most Celts had been robbed of their faith, taught the ways of the Roman's dead god. But the faith of the Druids has been brought back from the brink of destruction! Now, [Root.GetFullName], [Root.GetTitle] of the Gaels, loyal adherent to [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], has united much of The Isles and declared [Root.GetReflexivePronoun] the rightful ruler of all Alba! Henceforth, [Root.GetSheHe] shall be known as Emperor!;Il y a longtemps que les peuples celtes étaient divisés, cueillettes faciles pour les conquérants au cours des millénaires.

celt.13.title;Warbands Convert;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.13.desc;The ancient religion of the Celts has long been in decline. Now the faith appears to have finally vanished for good and soon none who remember the old gods will remain. However the Insular Christians, following the example set by Saint Patrick to keep that which does not clash with the Word of God, have preserved the old ways in a new Christian context. Now that the last of the pagan chiefs have dissapeared, the roving warbands they once maintained have turned to their Christian kinsmen for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.14.desc;An age of holy war is upon us. In order to better protect Insular pilgrims, a group of holy warriors calling themselves the Red Dragon Knights have banded together to defend the faith. Following the example set by the holy orders of mainland Europe, the Red Dragon Knights will fight for any Insular ruler capable of paying their maintanance, but will not fight against other Insular Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.16.desc;The Gaelic people of Ireland and Great Britain experienced an era of learning and prosperity while the rest of Europe languished in a dark age after the fall of Rome. Attracted by its wealth and prestige, the land of saints and scholars now faces constant invasions by jealous Saxons and Norsemen. In order to better protect their lands from invasion [Root.GetFullName], great King of the Gaels, has united the kingdoms of Ireland and Scotland and declared [Root.GetReflexivePronoun] Imperator Scottorum. [Root.GetFullName] will surely be remembered as one of the greatest rulers the British Isles have ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.49.title;King of Mann;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.49.desc;Mann has long been overshadowed by the islands of Great Britain and Ireland and while the ruler of Mann has used the title of King in the past there are few who take this claim seriously. Now it seems our fortunes have turned as our great [Root.GetTitle], [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick], has expanded beyond the borders of our isle and brough wealth and prestige to Mann. From now on Mann will stand beside the great Kingdoms of Europe as an equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.51.title;Supporting the Papars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.51.desc;Irish hermits, referred to as the Papars by the foreigners, have lived in small numbers in Iceland in order to isolate themselves from worldly concerns and focus solely on God. While the Papars have been content to forego the protection of the Gaelic kings for the sake of isolation, the increasing activity of the Norse Vikings have made the North Sea a dangerous place. In order to protect the island from attack [supporter_of_papars_target.GetDynName], [supporter_of_papars_target.primary_title.GetRulerTitle] of [supporter_of_papars_target.primary_title.GetBaseName], has decided to settle many warriors and their families in Iceland. While the Papars are reluctant to give up their isolation, their leader [papar_leader_target.GetFirstName] has decided to accept the proposal for the sake of the lives under his care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.52.title;Paris Engulfed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.52.desc;The Seine, the major river that runs through Paris, has been running unusually high this year. Although the river is known to flood on occasion, the waters have still been within safe levels. That is until a sudden torrential downpour caused the Seine to break free from its banks. Paris was engulfed by a flood the likes of which it has never seen before. By the time the waters finally receded, Paris had been devastated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.52.a;What a catastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.53.title;The City of Ys;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.53.desc;The people of Brittany speak of a magestic city named Ys that was swallowed by the sea in an age long past. Though Ys was destroyed long ago, there are some who say that Ys will one day return when the city of Paris is engulfed. Curiously, some days after Paris was submerged by the flooding of the Seine, the waters of the Bay of Douarnenez receded , revealing what appears to be ruins of a large city. Now Bretons are coming from far and wide to see the legendary city for themselves. Though these ruins hardly live up to the legends in their current state, perhaps with some worth the city of Ys can be restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.54.desc;Victory is ours! How many generations of Cumbric men and women fought for this moment, we do not know. But what we do know is that we are now truly the masters of our old lands, Rheged, and you her first monarch in many centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.55.title;Rheged Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.55.desc;Against great odds, the Cumbric people have prevailed, and now control much of their ancestral lands under the Kingdom of Rheged once more. Though they are but a small part of the British isles, this victory could be just the beginning of greater things. Could Rheged reunite the Britons and reclaim the entire island?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.59.title;The Rebirth of Gaul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.59.desc;The land of Gaul was once occupied by Celtic tribes in the ancient past and while the land has now long been conquered by the Romans and the Franks, the memory of this ancient Celtic nation lives on. Now in a strange turn of events the land of Gaul is once again in Celtic hands. [Root.GetTitledNameWithNick] has declared the end of the rule of the Franks and the beginning of the Empire of Gaul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.60.desc;Through a series of deft marriages, the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has established descent from many of the most famous figures from history. At the same time, the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has produced some of the greatest heroes of our age. Where the descendants of other famous bloodlines would be content to rest on their laurels, members of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] bloodline have established a reputation for always searching for new ways to make a name for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.61.title;The Celtic Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.61.desc;The Celts were once the uncontested masters of Western Europe. Although the Celts have long been deprived of most of their lands and constrained to the remotest regions of Europe, generations of struggle have allowed the Celtic peoples to reclaim their lost lands. Now [Root.GetTitledNameWithNick] has united three great Celtic Empires and has decided to form a single Celtic Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.20.title;An Orderly Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.20.desc;The Uí Néill Dynasty has long claimed the High Kingship as its exclusive right. However, the many branches of this vast family have done little more than fight among themselves over control of the High Kingship. To put an end to this squabbling, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has declared that henceforth the High King will determine [Root.GetHerHis] successor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.20.a;This time the squabbling over the High Kingship is surely at its end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.20.b;But it was going to be my turn next!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.20.c;Perhaps I should take the High Kingship while I still can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.21.title;A Peaceful Tribute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.21.desc;While the High King has a right to tribute from the lesser Irish Kings, traditionally he was expected to extract this tribute by force as a show of his power. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to replace this with a more reliable form of tribute. After negotiating with [Root.GetHerHis] tributaries, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has announced a new peaceful tribute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.21.a;Work smarter not harder I always say;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.21.b;Its better than the old tribute at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.22.title;High King In More Than Name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.22.desc;Although the High King is supposed to be the overlord of all Irish king, in reality the High King has little power outside of the kingdom he personally rules. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] aspires to change this by creating a High Kingship with real authority. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is still a ways from making [Root.GetHerHis] dream a reality, but [Root.GetHerHis] actions have begun to worry the fiercly independent Irish kings. The most powerful kings have one final chance to claim the High Kingship for themselves or break free of [Root.GetFirstName]'s influence or else they will lose their independance to a united High Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.22.a;I will not stop until I am King of all of Ireland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.22.b;[Root.GetFirstName] must be stopped before it is too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.23.desc;Since the time of the Fir Bolg, through the age of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and to the arrival of the Milesians, the Island of Ireland has been ruled by a High King who claims hegemony over all other Irish Kings. Despite these lofty claims, the High King rarely wielded any real influence beyond his borders. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick] is the first High King to fully subjugate the entire Island to [Root.GetHerHis] will. No longer content to be first of a multitude of Kings, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has declared [Root.GetHerselfHimself] Rí hÉrenn Uile - King of All Ireland. Free from the constant feuding of the past, Ireland enters a new golden age of prosperity under [Root.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick];;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.23.desc.brian;After a seemingly endless struggle for High King Brian to keep rival kings pacified, it seems the unrest in Ireland has finally died down. With all of the Irish kings finally acknowledging him as the rightfull High King, High King Brian has decided to hold a ceremony at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh to announce his dominion over all of Ireland. Much to the surprise of all in attendance, Brian is announced not as Rí hÉrenn Uile, King of All Ireland, but as Imperator Scotorum, Emperor of the Gaels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.23.a;I am finally High King in more than name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Niall Noígíallach was perhaps the greatest High King in the history of Ireland.

Clearly [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] planned this trap as part of a ploy to take the kingship from me, but the oaths of my captors and the laws of hospitality should at least protect my life.

He dreamed of a free and united Ireland ruled by a High King with real power and while he managed to make major strides towards this goal in his life, with his death all of the minor kings that Brian had managed to keep in check have resumed fighting among themselves for the title of High King.

celt.2038.desc;After a seemingly endless struggle for High King Brian to keep rival kings pacified, it seems the unrest in Ireland has finally died down. With all of the Irish kings finally acknowledging him as the rightfull High King, High King Brian has decided to hold a ceremony at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh to announce his dominion over all of Ireland. Much to the surprise of all in attendance, Brian is announced not as Rí hÉrenn Uile, King of All Ireland, but as Imperator Scotorum, Emperor of the Gaels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, the foreign raiders from faraway Lochlann continue to pillage and ransack our land. Though my armies can easily repel them, each time they attack they managed to kill and plunder before we arrive. The only way we will ever be rid of these nuisances is to take the fight to them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until now none seemed capable of inflicting any more than temporary losses on the Northmen but now, against all odds, [Root.GetDynName] of [Root.GetBaseName] has managed to subdue the Northmen.

celt.2041.desc;A rather curious report has reached my ears. While we have been waging war against the [scottish_enemy.Culture.GetName], it seems some other force has been battling the [scottish_enemy.Culture.GetName] independently. There are many rumors about the man who leads them, some of them patently ridiculous, but what is known is that he leads a sizable band of warriors and he has been successful at repelling the [scottish_enemy.Culture.GetName]. Having desired to meet this man, I had ordered one of my vassals to find this man and bring him before me. This morning a fairly unassuming Scottish knight presented himself to me. He spoke 'I am William Wallace and I fight for the freedom of Scotland';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.1017.title;The Chief Relic of the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1017.desc;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] journey bearing a ragged book missing it's cover. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], I have recovered the pages of the great Gospel of Columcille which had been stolen by heathens!'  [relic_hunter.GetHeShe] pauses briefly before continuing, 'Though I am afraid the book's jeweled bindings were nowhere to be found.'\n\n Your initial feeling of disappointment is immediately washed away once you lay your eyes on the pages. The book is filled with the most stunning illustrations you have ever seen. A treasure binding can be replaced but it is clear that this masterwork cannot.\n\n Before you can make plans to have the great Gospel rebound, you must decide on an appropriate reward for your waiting [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1018.title;The Staff of Jesus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1018.desc;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, bearing a jeweled bishop's crozier. Holding it delicately, and clearly treating the object with devout respect, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] hands it to you. 'I have recovered the Bachal Isu, the crozier of Saint Patrick and the very staff of the Lord Jesus Christ.'\n\nInspecting the staff in your hands, you can tell that the staff's gold ornamentation is exquisite. There can be no doubt that this is the genuine Bachal Isu, the very symbol of spiritual authority in Ireland.\n\nYour [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1019.desc;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a jeweled cumdach. [relic_hunter.GetHeShe] claims that this book shrine contains The Cathach of St. Columba, said to guarentee victory in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1020.desc;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] presents you with an exquisitely decorated golden processional cross. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] assures me that this cross contains a fragment of the True Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1022.desc;My [rumor_councillor.GetJobTitle], [rumor_councillor.GetTitledFirstName],has brought me the most extraordinary news! Apparently [rumor_councillor.GetSheHe] has uncovered a rumor concerning a truly legendary artifact. [rumor_councillor.GetFirstName] tells me that securing the artifact will be an epic quest worthy of King Arthur himself. [rumor_councillor.GetFirstName] requests that [rumor_councillor.getHeShe] be put in charge of organizing this expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

celt.1023.desc;After years spent questing far from home, your knights, led by [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName], have returned. Bowing before you, your knights present a small box to you. Your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] speaks 'My Lord after many trials we have completed the great mission of King Arthur. We have recovered the Holy Grail itself!'\n\nBarely able to contain your excitement, you open the box and see a simple chalice. The cup Jesus used to serve wine at The Last Supper, the vessel that caught the blood of Christ, the relic that King Arthur sought. There is no artifact as storied as the one you now hold in your hands.\n\nNo doubt the bards will tell of this accomplishment for years to come, but your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] seems to be awaiting a more immediate reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1024.title;The Spear of Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1024.desc;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName], flanked by your loyal knights, has returned, bearing an ancient looking lance. Your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] and your knights kneel and offer the lance to you. 'We have recovered the Holy Lance that pierced the side of the Lord, Jesus Christ.'\n\nHolding the lance in your hands you can feel the significance of this relic. It is said that Jesus bled blood and water when his side was pierced by Saint Longinus. Surely a weapon that has been touched by the Blood of Christ would make its wielder invincible in battle!\n\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the lance's potential power creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celt.1025.title;The Shroud of Jesus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holding a small metal box, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] appears befor you and, bowing," offers it to you. 'My Lord, I have searched far and wide", and have found you the burial shroud of Jesus Christ, himself!'\n\nOpening the box to sate your curiosity, you indeed find what appears to be a burial shroud of some sort, though an unremarkable one. Just as you begin to question the authenticty of the find, you notice the image of a man's face that bears an unmistakable resemblance to the face of Jesus! There can be no further doubt that this is the genuine article.\n\nSeemingly Expecting you to speak, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
